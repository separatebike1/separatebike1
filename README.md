Hello, World!

These are my solo projects made in C using some skills i learned from CS50x.
Currently on Section 1, then im gonna learn arrays from Week 2, to see
what solo projects i can make with them, and with the other concepts like
algorithms, memory, data structures and other, that im gonna learn in the future.

Good luck to myself!!
