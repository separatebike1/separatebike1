Hello, World!

These are my solo projects made in C using some skills i learned from CS50x.
Currently on Week 4, or Memory, then im gonna learn Data Structures from Week 5,
to see what solo projects i can make with them, and with the other concepts
that im gonna learn in the future.

Good luck to myself!!

PS:
  After finishing the course, im gonna learn Java to become a back end developer!
