# Hello, World!

### These are my solo projects made in C using some skills i learned from CS50x. Pretty useless, but i just put them here for fun!

#### i know that i f'ed up on the sorter because i used bubble sort because it was easier for me to make and i know its slow since its time complexity is O(n^(2))
